# AoC2023

Last year I managed to solve all of the puzzles before the end of the 25th, which I was very happy with. This time I will try to complete every day before the next day unlocks, and do them as fast as possible! I am actually in a proper timezone for this one so I can start right as the day releases. Downside is I have finals during this time so that might compromise things.
